Mark, solid scaffolding — but there are a few landmines here that will hurt you in prod. I’ll keep it blunt and practical.

# What needs fixing (by priority)

## 1) Don’t spawn your own Vert.x inside a factory (seriously)

You create fresh Vert.x instances in `createFallbackClientFactory(...)`:

```java
new PgClientFactory(Vertx.vertx())
```

That spins up new event-loop threads and an independent lifecycle you do **not** control from the app. You’ll leak threads, double-metrics, and make graceful shutdown unreliable.

**Fix:** never create Vert.x here. If you can’t obtain a `PgClientFactory` from `DatabaseService`, **fail fast**. Or add a constructor that accepts a shared `Vertx` and use that (still meh). Best is to **change `DatabaseService` to expose what you need** (see “API tweaks” below).

## 2) Reflection spelunking into `DatabaseService` is brittle

You reflect `manager` and a private `metrics` field. That will break on refactors, shading, or different impls.

**Fix:** evolve the interface:

* `DatabaseService#as(PgClientFactory.class)` **or**
* `DatabaseService#pool(String clientId)` / `#vertx()` / `#metrics()`

Do **not** rely on class names like `"PgDatabaseService"` or `"PgMetricsProvider"`.

## 3) “Fallback” config via system properties is the wrong abstraction

Reading `peegeeq.database.*` system properties from deep inside `OutboxFactory` creates hidden runtime coupling and surprising behavior.

**Fix:** remove `createFallbackConnectionConfig()` entirely. Outbox should **either**:

* use the provided `PgClientFactory`/`DatabaseService`, or
* throw with a clear message (“No clientFactory/databaseService provided”).

Your middleware should not guess DB credentials.

## 4) Health check is weak

Currently:

* If `databaseService != null`: delegate to `databaseService.isHealthy()` (ok, assuming it’s real).
* Else you call `connectionManager.isHealthy()` — but your manager’s `isHealthy()` just checks non-null pools.

**Fix:** perform a real `SELECT 1` against the pool (one of: the “peegeeq-main” or the topic’s bound client). If you can’t get a pool, report unhealthy.

## 5) Lifecycle: closing “shared” Vert.x from here is dangerous

`OutboxFactory.close()` calls:

```java
OutboxConsumer.closeSharedVertx();
OutboxProducer.closeSharedVertx();
```

If that “shared” instance is used elsewhere, you just killed the app’s event loops. A factory that **didn’t create Vert.x** shouldn’t close it.

**Fix:** remove this. Let the top-level `PeeGeeQManager` own Vert.x lifecycle. If the producer/consumer create internal Vert.x instances, that’s their bug — fix them to use the app’s shared Vert.x.

## 6) You might create a new PgClientFactory per consumer (leak risk)

In the `databaseService != null` branch you call `createFallbackClientFactory(databaseService)` inside `createConsumer(...)`. That may produce multiple factories with their own pools and (worse) their own Vert.x if you don’t fix #1.

**Fix:** resolve the effective factory **once** in the constructor and store it. If it doesn’t exist, fail fast.

## 7) Topic and payload validation

You accept any `topic` and `payloadType`. If they’re blank/null, you’ll fail deeper.

**Fix:** validate early:

```java
if (topic == null || topic.isBlank()) throw new IllegalArgumentException("topic");
if (payloadType == null) throw new IllegalArgumentException("payloadType");
```

## 8) Resource tracking is synchronous and type-opaque

You track `AutoCloseable` and call `close()` synchronously. If those close methods block (I/O), and you ever run this on an event-loop context, you’ll stall the loop.

**Fix:** prefer an async close contract (e.g., an interface with `Future<Void> closeAsync()`), or at least ensure close happens on a worker thread. If you keep `AutoCloseable`, document that callers must not run `close()` on the event loop.

## 9) Logging level and PII

You log DB usernames and configuration presence at `INFO`. That’s noisy and can leak information.

**Fix:** drop most of these to `DEBUG`. Never log credentials.

# Concrete patches (drop-in)

### A) Kill reflection and fallback; resolve factory once

```java
// New constructor: require one of these two. No reflection, no guessing.
public OutboxFactory(PgClientFactory clientFactory, ObjectMapper objectMapper, PeeGeeQConfiguration configuration) {
  this.clientFactory = Objects.requireNonNull(clientFactory);
  this.databaseService = null;
  this.legacyMetrics = null;  // or inject explicitly
  this.configuration = configuration;
  this.objectMapper = objectMapper != null ? objectMapper : createDefaultObjectMapper();
}

public OutboxFactory(DatabaseService databaseService, ObjectMapper objectMapper, PeeGeeQConfiguration configuration) {
  this.databaseService = Objects.requireNonNull(databaseService);
  this.clientFactory = databaseService.as(PgClientFactory.class)  // <— add this API
      .orElseThrow(() -> new IllegalStateException("DatabaseService does not expose PgClientFactory"));
  this.legacyMetrics = databaseService.getMetricsProvider().as(PeeGeeQMetrics.class).orElse(null); // <— API
  this.configuration = configuration;
  this.objectMapper = objectMapper != null ? objectMapper : createDefaultObjectMapper();
}
```

If you can’t change `DatabaseService` immediately, still **remove** the Vert.x creation and system-property fallback. Fail fast with a clear message.

### B) Real health check

```java
@Override
public boolean isHealthy() {
  if (closed) return false;
  try {
    if (databaseService != null) return databaseService.isHealthy();
    if (clientFactory != null) {
      return clientFactory.getPool("peegeeq-main")
          .map(pool -> pool.withConnection(conn -> conn.query("SELECT 1").execute().mapEmpty())
               .toCompletionStage().toCompletableFuture().get()) // if you must block; prefer async health API
          .isPresent();
    }
    return false;
  } catch (Exception e) {
    logger.warn("OutboxFactory health check failed", e);
    return false;
  }
}
```

Better: expose an async `Future<Boolean> isHealthyAsync()` and avoid blocking.

### C) Remove shared Vert.x shutdown

```java
@Override
public void close() throws Exception {
  if (closed) return;
  closed = true;

  for (AutoCloseable resource : createdResources) {
    try { resource.close(); }
    catch (Exception e) { logger.warn("Error closing resource {}: {}", resource.getClass().getSimpleName(), e.getMessage()); }
  }
  createdResources.clear();

  // Do NOT close shared Vert.x here.
}
```

### D) Validate inputs and reduce logging noise

```java
private static void validateTopic(String topic, Class<?> payloadType) {
  if (topic == null || topic.isBlank()) throw new IllegalArgumentException("topic must be non-blank");
  if (payloadType == null) throw new IllegalArgumentException("payloadType must be non-null");
}

@Override
public <T> MessageProducer<T> createProducer(String topic, Class<T> payloadType) {
  checkNotClosed(); validateTopic(topic, payloadType);
  var metrics = getMetrics();
  var producer = (databaseService != null)
      ? new OutboxProducer<>(databaseService, objectMapper, topic, payloadType, metrics)
      : new OutboxProducer<>(clientFactory, objectMapper, topic, payloadType, metrics);
  createdResources.add(producer);
  return producer;
}
```

# API tweaks I strongly recommend

* **DatabaseService** should provide these (no reflection):

  * `Optional<PgClientFactory> as(Class<PgClientFactory>)` **or** explicit `getPgClientFactory()`
  * `Optional<Pool> pool(String clientId)`
  * `Vertx vertx()` (shared instance)
  * `Optional<PeeGeeQMetrics> metrics()`
* **MessageProducer/Consumer** should expose `Future<Void> closeAsync()`; factory should have an async `close` too.
* **OutboxConsumer/Producer** must **not** own Vert.x; they should take `Vertx` from above (or only use `Pool`).

---

# Smaller nits (still worth addressing)

* `createdResources` is fine, but consider tracking by interface: `List<AsyncCloseable>` for clarity.
* ObjectMapper: you already create once; good. Make sure you don’t re-create per producer.
* `getImplementationType()` → perhaps include a version (`outbox:v1`), useful for diagnostics.
* Consumer group path is good; make sure group membership coordination is transactional in the outbox table (that’s in other classes, but call it out).

---

# TL;DR

* **Do not** create Vert.x or DB configs in `OutboxFactory`. It’s not this class’s job.
* **Remove** reflection hacks; **extend** `DatabaseService` so you can get the pool/factory legitimately.
* **Real** health checks, **no** shared-Vert.x shutdown from here.
* Resolve the client factory **once** in the constructor; fail fast if not available.
* Validate inputs; reduce INFO logs.

If you paste `OutboxProducer`/`OutboxConsumer` next, I’ll check the transactional envelope (insert domain row + outbox row atomically, publish via a separate process, idempotency keying, retry semantics, and how you handle backoff).
