## Introduction

### Purpose

This document proposes to establish a standardised approach to event-driven architecture for financial services organizations using PeeGeeQ's bitemporal event store. It provides:

- **Systematic event naming conventions** that work across all financial domains
- **Comprehensive event dictionary** covering trading, custody, treasury, funds, and securities services
- **Technical implementation patterns** for PeeGeeQ integration
- **Migration strategies** for adopting standardized events

### Key Principles

1. **Business-Centric**: Events represent real business activities and outcomes
2. **Cross-Domain Consistency**: Same patterns work across trading, custody, funds, and regulatory domains
3. **Future-Proof**: Naming and structure scales to new business requirements
4. **Audit-Ready**: Complete traceability for regulatory compliance
5. **Developer-Friendly**: Clear, predictable patterns reduce complexity

### Financial Services Domains Covered

- **Trading**: Trade capture, confirmation, and lifecycle management
- **Custody**: Settlement instructions, confirmations, and position management
- **Treasury**: Cash movements, liquidity management, and funding
- **Fund Administration**: NAV calculation, subscriptions, redemptions, and transfers
- **Securities Services**: DVP/FOP settlement, securities lending, and safekeeping
- **Regulatory**: Compliance monitoring, reporting, and threshold management
- **Operations**: Exception management, reconciliation, and manual repairs

---

## Event Naming Strategy

### The Challenge

Creating event names that are:
1. **Meaningful** - clearly describe what happened
2. **Unique** - no conflicts across domains  
3. **Consistent** - follow predictable patterns
4. **Scalable** - work for new domains/processes

### Event Naming Pattern: `{entity}.{action}.{state}`

Event names follow a three-part pattern where:
- **Entity**: The business object being acted upon
- **Action**: The business action being performed  
- **State**: The resulting state or outcome

### Why This Works

#### 1. Meaningful: Each name tells a complete story
- `trade.capture.completed` - A trade was captured and it completed successfully
- `instruction.settlement.matched` - A settlement instruction was matched with counterparty
- `position.reconciliation.failed` - A position reconciliation process failed

#### 2. Unique: Three-part names eliminate conflicts
- `trade.confirmation.received` (Trading domain)
- `nav.validation.received` (Funds domain) 
- `report.regulatory.received` (Regulatory domain)

#### 3. Consistent: Same pattern across all domains
- All events follow `{entity}.{action}.{state}` structure
- Predictable naming makes integration easier

#### 4. Scalable: Easy to add new events
- New entities: `collateral`, `proxy-voting`, `corporate-action`
- New actions: `substitution`, `recall`, `escalation`
- New states: `breached`, `acknowledged`, `disputed`

**Important**: Entity names must not contain dots (.) as they would be misinterpreted in the `{entity}.{action}.{state}` pattern. Use kebab-case instead:
- ✅ `proxy-voting.instruction.received`
- ❌ `proxy.voting.instruction.received` (would be parsed as entity=`proxy`, action=`voting`, state=`instruction`)

### System Context: Why Not Include System Names?

A common question is whether event names should include the source system, like `trading-system.trade.capture.completed`. I recommend **against** this approach for several reasons:

#### Arguments Against System Prefixes
1. **Business Focus**: Events should represent business facts, **not** technical implementation details
2. **System Independence**: `trade.capture.completed` is a business fact regardless of which system captured it
3. **Coupling**: Adding system names couples the event schema to a technical architecture
4. **Evolution**: Systems get replaced, merged, or split - business events remain constant

#### CloudEvents Already Handles System Context

The CloudEvents specification provides the `source` field specifically for system identification:

```json
{
  "specversion": "1.0",
  "type": "com.fincorp.trading.equities.capture.TradeCaptured.v1",
  "source": "murex-trading-system",
  "id": "01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef",
  "time": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "subject": "trade-12345",
  "data": {
    "eventName": "trade.capture.completed",
    "tradeId": "12345",
    "instrumentId": "AAPL",
    "quantity": 1000
  }
}
```

This approach separates **business semantics** (event name) from **technical context** (source system), providing the best of both worlds: clear business meaning with full system traceability.

### Construction Rules

#### Entities (Business Objects)

| Domain | Entities |
|--------|----------|
| Core Trading | trade, order, execution, allocation |
| Settlement | instruction, settlement, confirmation, matching |
| Positions | position, movement, transfer, safekeeping |
| Cash | cash, payment, funding, liquidity |
| Funds | nav, subscription, redemption, transfer, dividend |
| Securities Services | lending, collateral, recall, dvp, fop |
| Operations | exception, break, repair, reconciliation |
| Regulatory | compliance, report, threshold, violation |
| Corporate Actions | corporate-action, entitlement, election, proxy-voting |
| Reference Data | counterparty, security, account, rate |

#### Actions (Business Processes)

| Category | Actions |
|----------|---------|
| Lifecycle | capture, creation, initiation, generation |
| Processing | processing, calculation, validation, verification |
| Workflow | confirmation, approval, authorization, assignment |
| Movement | settlement, transfer, movement, delivery |
| Monitoring | detection, investigation, monitoring, checking |
| Resolution | resolution, repair, correction, escalation |
| Communication | notification, reporting, submission, announcement |

#### States (Outcomes)

| Category | States |
|----------|--------|
| Initiation | initiated, started, requested, created, generated |
| In-Progress | processing, pending, validating, investigating |
| Success | completed, finished, settled, matched, approved, confirmed |
| Failure | failed, rejected, disputed, unmatched, insufficient |
| Exceptional | breached, violated, escalated, expired, suspended |
| Resolution | resolved, corrected, repaired, acknowledged |

### Naming Constraints

#### No Dots in Individual Components
Since the pattern uses dots as delimiters (`{entity}.{action}.{state}`), individual components cannot contain dots:

**Problematic Examples:**
```
proxy.voting.instruction.received
```
This would be incorrectly parsed as:
- Entity: `proxy`
- Action: `voting`
- State: `instruction`
- Extra: `received` (invalid)

**Correct Examples:**
```
proxy-voting.instruction.received    → Entity: proxy-voting, Action: instruction, State: received
corporate-action.announcement.published → Entity: corporate-action, Action: announcement, State: published
```

#### Recommended Separators
- **Kebab-case** for multi-word components: `proxy-voting`, `corporate-action`
- **Dots** only as pattern delimiters: `{entity}.{action}.{state}`

### Benefits

1. **Developer Friendly**: Clear, predictable naming patterns
2. **Business Friendly**: Names describe actual business processes
3. **Future-Proof**: Easy to extend with new entities, actions, and states
4. **Cross-Domain Consistency**: Works consistently across all financial services domains
5. **Audit Ready**: Event names clearly describe what happened in business terms
6. **Technical Integration**: Easy routing (`*.settlement.*`), filtering, and monitoring

## Event Structure & Standards

### CloudEvents Envelope

All events use CloudEvents specification as the standard envelope:

```json
{
  "specversion": "1.0",
  "type": "com.fincorp.trading.equities.capture.TradeCaptured.v1",
  "source": "trading-system",
  "id": "01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef",
  "time": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "datacontenttype": "application/avro",
  "dataschema": "https://schemas.fincorp.com/trading/TradeCaptured/v1",
  "subject": "trade-12345",
  "traceparent": "00-4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736-00f067aa0ba902b7-01",
  "correlationid": "correlation-12345",
  "causationid": "causation-67890",
  "data": {
    // Avro-serialized payload
  }
}
```

### Required Headers

- **traceparent**: W3C Trace Context for end-to-end tracing
- **correlationid**: Links related events in a business process
- **causationid**: Identifies the event that caused this event
- **validtime**: Business effective time (bi-temporal)
- **partitionkey**: Explicit partitioning for ordering

### Event Type Naming Convention

```
com.{organization}.{domain}.{instrument-category}.{process}.{EventName}.v{version}
```

Examples:
- `com.fincorp.trading.equities.capture.TradeCaptured.v1`
- `com.fincorp.custody.bonds.settlement.instruction.SettlementInstructed.v1`
- `com.fincorp.funds.equity.funds.nav.calculation.NavCalculated.v1`

### Payload Schema Standards

#### Avro Schema Structure
```json
{
  "type": "record",
  "name": "TradeCapturedPayload",
  "namespace": "com.fincorp.trading.events",
  "fields": [
    {"name": "tradeId", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "instrumentId", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "quantity", "type": {"type": "bytes", "logicalType": "decimal", "precision": 18, "scale": 8}},
    {"name": "price", "type": {"type": "bytes", "logicalType": "decimal", "precision": 18, "scale": 8}},
    {"name": "counterpartyId", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "traderId", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "tradeDate", "type": {"type": "long", "logicalType": "timestamp-millis"}},
    {"name": "validTime", "type": {"type": "long", "logicalType": "timestamp-millis"}},
    {"name": "jurisdiction", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "notionalAmount", "type": {"type": "bytes", "logicalType": "decimal", "precision": 18, "scale": 8}}
  ]
}
```

### Routing Key Strategy

Format: `{domain}.{instrument}.{process}.{region}.{priority}`

Examples:
- `trading.equities.capture.us.high`
- `custody.bonds.settlement.eu.normal`
- `funds.equity.funds.nav.calculation.global.critical`

Priority Levels:
- **critical**: Regulatory deadlines, system failures
- **high**: Large transactions, time-sensitive operations
- **normal**: Standard business operations
- **low**: Reporting, analytics, non-urgent processes

## PeeGeeQ Integration Patterns

### Bi-temporal Event Store Configuration

```java
@Configuration
public class FinancialEventStoreConfig {

    @Bean
    public EventStore<TradeCapturedPayload> tradingEventStore() {
        return PgBiTemporalEventStore.<TradeCapturedPayload>builder()
            .withDataSource(tradingDataSource)
            .withTableName("trading_events")
            .withRoutingKeyExtractor(event ->
                generateTradingRoutingKey(event.getPayload()))
            .withSubscriptionFilters(Map.of(
                "high-value-trades", "payload.notionalAmount > 1000000",
                "failed-trades", "payload.status = 'FAILED'",
                "regulatory-reportable", "payload.notionalAmount > 500000"
            ))
            .build();
    }

    @Bean
    public EventStore<SettlementInstructedPayload> custodyEventStore() {
        return PgBiTemporalEventStore.<SettlementInstructedPayload>builder()
            .withDataSource(custodyDataSource)
            .withTableName("custody_events")
            .withRoutingKeyExtractor(event ->
                generateCustodyRoutingKey(event.getPayload()))
            .withSubscriptionFilters(Map.of(
                "failed-settlements", "payload.status = 'FAILED'",
                "high-value-settlements", "payload.notionalAmount > 5000000",
                "cross-border", "payload.jurisdiction != 'domestic'"
            ))
            .build();
    }
}
```

### Event Publishing Patterns

```java
@Service
public class TradingEventPublisher {

    private final EventStore<TradeCapturedPayload> eventStore;

    public void publishTradeCapture(Trade trade) {
        TradeCapturedPayload payload = TradeCapturedPayload.builder()
            .tradeId(trade.getId())
            .instrumentId(trade.getInstrumentId())
            .quantity(trade.getQuantity())
            .price(trade.getPrice())
            .counterpartyId(trade.getCounterpartyId())
            .traderId(trade.getTraderId())
            .tradeDate(trade.getTradeDate())
            .validTime(trade.getTradeDate()) // Business time
            .jurisdiction(trade.getJurisdiction())
            .notionalAmount(trade.getNotionalAmount())
            .build();

        BiTemporalEvent<TradeCapturedPayload> event = BiTemporalEvent.<TradeCapturedPayload>builder()
            .eventId(UuidV7.generate()) // Time-ordered UUID
            .eventType("com.fincorp.trading.equities.capture.TradeCaptured.v1")
            .source("trading-system")
            .subject("trade-" + trade.getId())
            .correlationId(trade.getCorrelationId())
            .causationId(trade.getCausationId())
            .validTime(trade.getTradeDate())
            .payload(payload)
            .build();

        eventStore.append(event);
    }
}
```

### Event Subscription Patterns

```java
@Component
public class FinancialEventHandlers {

    // Subscribe to all trade capture events
    @EventHandler
    public void handleTradeCaptured(
            @EventPattern("trading.*.capture.*.") BiTemporalEvent<TradeCapturedPayload> event) {

        // Update risk positions
        riskService.updatePosition(event);

        // Generate settlement instructions
        settlementService.createSettlementInstruction(event);

        // Check regulatory thresholds
        regulatoryService.checkThresholds(event);
    }

    // Subscribe to high-value transactions across all domains
    @EventHandler
    public void handleHighValueTransactions(
            @EventPattern("*.*.*.*.high") BiTemporalEvent<BaseFinancialEventPayload> event) {

        // Enhanced monitoring for large transactions
        monitoringService.trackHighValueTransaction(event);

        // Compliance review
        complianceService.reviewTransaction(event);
    }

    // Subscribe to all failed events for exception management
    @EventHandler
    public void handleFailedEvents(
            @EventPattern("*.*.*.*.") BiTemporalEvent<BaseFinancialEventPayload> event) {

        if ("FAILED".equals(event.getPayload().getStatus())) {
            exceptionService.createException(event);
        }
    }
}
```

### Bi-temporal Query Patterns

```java
@Service
public class FinancialEventQueryService {

    private final EventStore<BaseFinancialEventPayload> eventStore;

    // Query events as they were known at a specific point in time
    public List<BiTemporalEvent<BaseFinancialEventPayload>> getEventsAsOfSystemTime(
            String aggregateId, Instant systemTime) {

        return eventStore.findByAggregateId(aggregateId)
            .asOfSystemTime(systemTime)
            .toList();
    }

    // Query events that were valid during a specific business time period
    public List<BiTemporalEvent<BaseFinancialEventPayload>> getEventsValidDuring(
            String aggregateId, Instant validFrom, Instant validTo) {

        return eventStore.findByAggregateId(aggregateId)
            .validTimeBetween(validFrom, validTo)
            .toList();
    }

    // Query for audit trail - show all corrections and their history
    public List<BiTemporalEvent<BaseFinancialEventPayload>> getAuditTrail(
            String aggregateId) {

        return eventStore.findByAggregateId(aggregateId)
            .includeCorrections()
            .orderBySystemTime()
            .toList();
    }
}
```

## Implementation Examples

### Complete Trade Lifecycle Example

```java
// 1. Trade Capture
@EventHandler
public void handleTradeExecution(TradeExecutionEvent execution) {
    // Publish trade captured event
    publishEvent("trade.capture.completed",
        TradeCapturedPayload.from(execution));
}

// 2. Trade Confirmation
@EventHandler
public void handleTradeCaptured(
        @EventPattern("trade.capture.completed") BiTemporalEvent<TradeCapturedPayload> event) {

    // Send confirmation to counterparty
    confirmationService.sendConfirmation(event.getPayload());

    // Publish confirmation requested event
    publishEvent("trade.confirmation.requested",
        TradeConfirmationPayload.from(event.getPayload()));
}

// 3. Settlement Instruction Generation
@EventHandler
public void handleTradeConfirmed(
        @EventPattern("trade.confirmation.received") BiTemporalEvent<TradeConfirmationPayload> event) {

    // Generate settlement instruction
    SettlementInstruction instruction = settlementService.createInstruction(event.getPayload());

    // Publish settlement instruction created event
    publishEvent("instruction.settlement.created",
        SettlementInstructedPayload.from(instruction));
}

// 4. Position Update
@EventHandler
public void handleSettlementCompleted(
        @EventPattern("instruction.settlement.completed") BiTemporalEvent<SettlementInstructedPayload> event) {

    // Update positions
    positionService.updatePosition(event.getPayload());

    // Publish position update event
    publishEvent("position.update.applied",
        PositionUpdatedPayload.from(event.getPayload()));
}
```

### Exception Handling Example

```java
@EventHandler
public void handleSettlementFailure(
        @EventPattern("instruction.settlement.failed") BiTemporalEvent<SettlementInstructedPayload> event) {

    // Create exception record
    Exception exception = exceptionService.createException(
        event.getPayload().getInstructionId(),
        "SETTLEMENT_FAILURE",
        event.getPayload().getFailureReason()
    );

    // Publish exception detected event
    publishEvent("exception.detection.automated",
        ExceptionManagedPayload.from(exception));

    // Assign to operations team
    operationsService.assignException(exception.getId());

    // Publish exception assignment event
    publishEvent("exception.assignment.completed",
        ExceptionManagedPayload.from(exception));
}
```
