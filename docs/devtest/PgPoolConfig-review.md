Alright ‚Äî this one‚Äôs cleanly written, but you‚Äôre carrying **HikariCP-era baggage** into a **Vert.x reactive pool**, and it matters. Let‚Äôs be very clear:

Vert.x 5‚Äôs `PoolOptions` **does not** use (or even recognize) `minimumIdle`, `maxLifetime`, `connectionTimeout`, or `autoCommit`. Those are JDBC relics. If you keep them here, you‚Äôre fooling future readers and possibly yourself about what‚Äôs actually enforced.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues (and what they imply)

### 1. **JDBC semantics in a reactive world**

* `minimumIdle`, `maxLifetime`, and `autoCommit` have **no effect** in Vert.x `Pool`.
* Vert.x doesn‚Äôt maintain pre-warmed idle connections or lifetime eviction.
* It uses **max pool size**, **wait queue size**, **idle timeout**, and **connection timeout** only.

üëâ **Fix**: either drop those fields or rename them to Vert.x concepts:

* `maxWaitQueueSize`
* `idleTimeout` (fine)
* `connectionTimeout` (fine)
* maybe `maxSize` instead of `maximumPoolSize` to match API names

You‚Äôre trying to make this ‚Äúfeel like‚Äù a drop-in for JDBC users, but that‚Äôs misleading for ops and performance tuning.

---

### 2. **No `maxWaitQueueSize`**

Without it, a storm of callers will happily queue an unbounded number of requests waiting for a pool connection ‚Äî blowing up memory under backpressure conditions.
You need this knob:

```java
private final int maxWaitQueueSize;
```

Default should be something like `128` (Vert.x default) ‚Äî configurable.

---

### 3. **Timeouts are in `long` but should be `Duration`**

Vert.x 5‚Äôs `PoolOptions` uses `Duration` for timeouts (and so should your config). Using `long` is ambiguous ‚Äî are those ms, seconds, ns?

üëâ **Fix**: switch to `Duration` everywhere, and clarify in builder methods.

---

### 4. **`shared = true` is good, but document semantics**

Vert.x 5‚Äôs shared pool means ‚Äúuse same underlying pool across verticles with same name‚Äù ‚Äî not ‚Äúthread-shared globally‚Äù. It‚Äôs fine, but document it explicitly. If you use multiple services in the same Vert.x instance, *sharing is fine only if configs match*.

---

### 5. **Defaults are small and unrealistic for prod**

You‚Äôre using 8 connections, probably because you tested locally.
For production, your config system should pull these from YAML/env and *not* bake them into builder defaults.

---

### 6. **Missing `maxWaitQueueSize` and `idleTimeout` units**

`idleTimeout` is in ms here, but Vert.x expects `Duration`. Using mismatched units silently causes wrong behavior.

---

## ‚úÖ Recommended structure (Vert.x idiomatic + safe)

Here‚Äôs a future-proof replacement:

```java
package dev.mars.peegeeq.db.config;

import java.time.Duration;
import java.util.Objects;

/**
 * Reactive PostgreSQL pool configuration for Vert.x 5.x.
 */
public final class PgPoolConfig {
  private final int maxSize;
  private final int maxWaitQueueSize;
  private final Duration connectionTimeout;
  private final Duration idleTimeout;
  private final boolean shared;

  private PgPoolConfig(Builder b) {
    this.maxSize = b.maxSize;
    this.maxWaitQueueSize = b.maxWaitQueueSize;
    this.connectionTimeout = b.connectionTimeout;
    this.idleTimeout = b.idleTimeout;
    this.shared = b.shared;
  }

  public int getMaxSize() { return maxSize; }
  public int getMaxWaitQueueSize() { return maxWaitQueueSize; }
  public Duration getConnectionTimeout() { return connectionTimeout; }
  public Duration getIdleTimeout() { return idleTimeout; }
  public boolean isShared() { return shared; }

  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return "PgPoolConfig{" +
        "maxSize=" + maxSize +
        ", maxWaitQueueSize=" + maxWaitQueueSize +
        ", connectionTimeout=" + connectionTimeout +
        ", idleTimeout=" + idleTimeout +
        ", shared=" + shared +
        '}';
  }

  public static final class Builder {
    private int maxSize = 16;
    private int maxWaitQueueSize = 128;
    private Duration connectionTimeout = Duration.ofSeconds(30);
    private Duration idleTimeout = Duration.ofMinutes(10);
    private boolean shared = true;

    public Builder maxSize(int v) { this.maxSize = v; return this; }
    public Builder maxWaitQueueSize(int v) { this.maxWaitQueueSize = v; return this; }
    public Builder connectionTimeout(Duration v) { this.connectionTimeout = Objects.requireNonNull(v); return this; }
    public Builder idleTimeout(Duration v) { this.idleTimeout = Objects.requireNonNull(v); return this; }
    public Builder shared(boolean v) { this.shared = v; return this; }

    public PgPoolConfig build() { return new PgPoolConfig(this); }
  }
}
```

Then in your `PgConnectionManager`:

```java
PoolOptions opts = new PoolOptions()
    .setMaxSize(cfg.getMaxSize())
    .setMaxWaitQueueSize(cfg.getMaxWaitQueueSize())
    .setIdleTimeout(cfg.getIdleTimeout())
    .setConnectionTimeout(cfg.getConnectionTimeout())
    .setShared(cfg.isShared());
```

## üéØ TL;DR for your current code

| Problem                                                   | Impact               | Fix                          |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| JDBC-only fields (`minIdle`, `maxLifetime`, `autoCommit`) | Misleading + unused  | Drop them                    |
| Missing `maxWaitQueueSize`                                | Potential OOM        | Add it                       |
| Timeouts in `long`                                        | Ambiguous            | Use `Duration`               |
| No doc on `shared`                                        | Confusion            | Add clear comment            |
| Defaults too low for prod                                 | Throttles throughput | Move to config/env overrides |

## Final verdict

You‚Äôre **95% there architecturally**, but this config class is still carrying 2010s connection-pool semantics. Vert.x 5.x is **fully reactive** ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúhold idle connections‚Äù or ‚Äúrecycle lifetime‚Äù.

Refactor it to reflect *Vert.x* semantics, not *HikariCP‚Äôs*.
That will save you and your ops team days of confusion later when ‚ÄúmaxLifetime=30min‚Äù doesn‚Äôt actually do anything.

---

If you want, send your `PgConnectionConfig` next ‚Äî that one often hides another subtle problem (SSL, Unix socket handling, or password exposure).
