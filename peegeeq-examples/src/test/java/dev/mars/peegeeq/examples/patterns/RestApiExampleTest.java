/**
 * INFRASTRUCTURE TEST: PeeGeeQ REST API Server Integration (CURRENTLY DISABLED)
 *
 * ⚠️  NOTE: All tests are currently SKIPPED due to Vert.x 4.x → 5.x migration issues.
 * ⚠️  NOTE: This test does NOT create or test any message queues directly.
 *
 * WHAT THIS WOULD TEST (when enabled):
 * - REST API server startup and configuration
 * - HTTP endpoints for queue management operations
 * - REST API integration with PeeGeeQ core functionality
 * - API health checks and metrics endpoints
 *
 * BUSINESS VALUE:
 * - Validates REST API integration works correctly
 * - Ensures HTTP interface to PeeGeeQ functionality
 * - Provides confidence in web service integration patterns
 *
 * CURRENT STATUS: Requires Vert.x 5.x migration before tests can be enabled
 *
 * @author Mark Andrew Ray-Smith Cityline Ltd
