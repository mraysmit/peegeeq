# JUnit Platform Configuration for peegeeq-examples
#
# IMPORTANT: Tests in this module use system properties for configuration,
# which are not thread-safe. All tests must run sequentially to avoid
# system property conflicts during parallel execution.
#
# This configuration ensures that all tests run in the same thread,
# preventing race conditions on system properties.

# Run all tests sequentially (no parallel execution)
junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.enabled = false

# Alternative: If parallel execution is needed in the future,
# use SAME_THREAD mode to ensure tests within the same class run sequentially
# junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.enabled = true
# junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.mode.default = same_thread
# junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.mode.classes.default = concurrent
