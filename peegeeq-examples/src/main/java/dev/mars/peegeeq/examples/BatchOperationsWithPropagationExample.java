 * TODO: Implement BatchOperationsWithPropagationExample
 *
 * This example should demonstrate:
 * - Processing multiple messages in batches for better performance
 * - How transaction context propagates across batch operations
 * - Batch commit/rollback scenarios
 * - Optimized bulk processing patterns
 *
 * This was previously implemented but removed during refactoring.
 * See git commit 9c5966ba for historical context.
