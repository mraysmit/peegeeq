 * TODO: Implement AutomaticTransactionManagementExample
 *
 * This example should demonstrate:
 * - Automatic transaction boundaries around message operations
 * - Transaction propagation between different components
 * - Rollback behavior when errors occur
 * - Integration with existing transaction managers
 *
 * This was previously implemented but removed during refactoring.
 * See git commit 9c5966ba for historical context.
